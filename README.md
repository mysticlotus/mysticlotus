- 👋 Hi, I’m @mysticlotus, You wear the best clothes that I've ever seen
I've seen your light and your poetry
And it's the best thing that there's ever been
You're both the beauty and the beast
That's how it is and that's how it end
Into another city where you live far away
That's how it is and that's how it end
You've seen my face but you've never heard my name
Oh no, oh oh
I said, "Don't call me sir
Oh, just call me JJ ;)
Don't call me lady
Just call me JJ
Don't call me mister
Just call me JJ
Don't call me sweetheart
Just call me J" :)
